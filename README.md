# LLRT with terraform sample

This repo provides a working sample of a serverless aws lambda based application that uses [LLRT javascript](https://github.com/awslabs/llrt) runtime. This sample includes also a fully working IaC with terraform.

This project can serve as a template for new serverless applications leveraging:

- [LLRT runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/llrt)
- along with typescript
- and terraform

> [!WARNING]
> LLRT is an experimental runtime and not fully compatible with Node.js. Some modules are not expected to work properly. You can find more on the Node.js/LLRT compatibility matrix here [here](https://github.com/awslabs/llrt?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility-matrix)
